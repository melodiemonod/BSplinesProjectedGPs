## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe public health consequences in the United States.
In this study, we use a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the age-specific COVID-19 attributable deaths over time in the United States. The model is specified by a novel non-parametric spatial approach over time and age, a low-rank Gaussian Process (GP) projected by regularised B-splines. We show that this projection defines a new GP with attractive smoothness and computational efficiency properties, derive its kernel function, and discuss the penalty terms induced by the projected GP. Simulation analyses and benchmark results show that the B-splines projected GP may perform better than standard B-splines and Bayesian P-splines, and equivalently well as a standard GP at considerably lower runtimes. 
We apply the model to weekly, age-stratified COVID-19 attributable deaths reported by the US Centers for Disease Control, which are subject to censoring and reporting biases. Using the B-splines projected GP, we can estimate longitudinal trends in COVID-19 associated deaths across the US by 1-year age bands. These estimates are instrumental to calculate age-specific mortality rates, describe variation in age-specific deaths across the US, and for fitting epidemic models. Here, we couple the model with age-specific vaccination rates to show that vaccination rates were significantly associated with the magnitude of resurgences in COVID-19 deaths during the summer 2021. With counterfactual analyses, we quantify the avoided COVID-19 deaths under lower vaccination rates and avoidable COVID-19 deaths under higher vaccination rates. The B-splines projected GP priors that we develop are likely an appealing addition to the arsenal of Bayesian regularising priors.
